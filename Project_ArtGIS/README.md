# project_artgis

Project to develop app BreArts.

## Description

This app is developed on the Flutter platform, designed for both iOS and Android deployment. The app is simplistic in nature, containing only 2 screens in its current state (home screen and map screen). The home screen contains an information icon showing the credits and sources used in making the data, with the map screen as the visualization of the data. Map data is originally collected from City of Brea,CA sources, modified to fit ArcGIS Pro functionality and personal use. 

The app is created in mind for easier and portable access to the public as a reference tool. As such, does not rely on location status or tracking for navigation. App holds capability to copy down address and plug into respective map apps.
